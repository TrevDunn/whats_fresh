This is a test of Atom's ability to outline in green if not committed to git.

Ongoing Questions:

	what does method "authorize" in application_controller.rb do?
		what is the purpose and where is it called?


Nov3 Questions:

Routes: Sessions and Relationships

	If routes to /user are resources :users,
		What are the explicit routes to:
			resources :users do
				resources :posts
			end

	How would "resources :sessions, except: :destroy"
		help as a route?

	Do sessions have routes? Do sessions need routes?
		Are there any routes that sessions cannot/shouldn't have?

Views: Sessions and Relationships

	What views to added 'posts' have to 'users?'
		Just new/create?

	What views do sessions have?
		New
			the one with FORM_TAGS

			<h4>Write a Post</h4>
!!!		<%= form_for [ @user, @post ] do |f| %>
		<p>
		  <%= f.label :title %><br>
		  <%= f.text_field :title %>
		</p>
		<p>
		  <%= f.label :body %><br>
		  <%= f.text_field :body %>
		</p>
		<p>
		  <%= f.submit 'Post Me' %>
		</p>
		<% end %>

	In this "new" post part of a user's Show view,
		how does it know to create a post and not a
			new user?
		does it need [@user, @post] (which mean User.find and Post.new respectively)



Models: Sessions and Relationships

	Do models have "validates :user_id" or like fields?

Controllers: Sessions and Relationships

	Do session controllers need Strong Params?
		How would we set those up?
	No?
